# Drum_Kit

It is Javascript containing code which has some of the various drum sounds which play as soon as you keypress the letter or click over them.
It contains majorly the addEventlistener through "keypress" and "click" events.
Had added some animations as well!!

## Hope you have great time playing with this:)
